**Aventurine** is a *playable character* in **Honkai: Star Rail.**

A *senior manager* in the **IPC Strategic Investment Department** and *one* of the *Ten Stonehearts*. His Cornerstone is **"Aventurine of stratagems."** He possesses an air of frivolity and doesn't shy away from *taking risks*. His constant smile makes it *difficult* for people to discern his **true feelings.**

He won his *current position* by wagering *against fate itself.* He views *life as a high-stakes, high-return investment*, and he plays this ***particular gamble with masterful ease.***

 ### MY NOTES AB WITH SPOILERS: 

Aventurine was a very *important character* in the **Penacony Arc**, his *first appearance* as far as I know was at the end of the **Topaz mission**, 
where she said she would lose her position for not having convinced Bronya to give Belobog, and replied said something about "dont worry" i forgot---

After that he appeared when Expresso Astral arrived at the *Penacony Hotel* and they had forgotten to notify the arrival of a new member to have a room for them, Aventurine giving the room to Trailblazer and saying that it was the best of all and a lot things happens after it.

**The arc isn't over yet**, he told about Aventurine's past and his deceased family and how he was the "last" (Not confirmed yet as even the blonde couldn't say if he was the only survivor from his land.)

PLEASE PLAY AND YOU WILL GET A BETTER EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT!! I'm terrible at summarizing things :(
